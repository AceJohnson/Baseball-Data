Hey guys,
I love Jacob Degrom so you get to see his spin rate with extension compared to batted ball results and swinging strike rate.

With his StatCast results I want to pin point pitchers who compare to his spin rate with similar success rates of ERA and OBP.
Maybe throw an X on those to determine which pitchers offer a similar pitch selection and deliveral worse results.
